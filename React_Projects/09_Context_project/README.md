# Context Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of React Context API to manage state across a React application. It showcases best practices for state management, component composition, and code organization in a scalable React project.

## Features
- **Global State Management**: Efficiently manage and share state across multiple components without prop drilling.
- **Context Providers**: Implement multiple context providers to handle different parts of the application state.
- **Custom Hooks**: Utilize custom hooks to encapsulate and reuse logic related to context.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize context usage to prevent unnecessary re-renders and improve application performance.
